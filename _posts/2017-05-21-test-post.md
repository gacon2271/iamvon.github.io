Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.


## Inline HTML elements

HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

- **To bold text**, use `**To bold text**`.
- *To italicize text*, use `*To italicize text*`.
- Abbreviations, like HTML should be defined like this `*[HTML]: HyperText Markup Language`.
- Citations, like <cite>&mdash; Von</cite>, should use `<cite>`.
- ~~Deleted~~ text should use `~~deleted~~` and <ins>inserted</ins> text should use `<ins>`.
- Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses `<sup>` and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses `<sub>`.

Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.

## Heading 2
## "Excellent! I cried. "Elementary," said he.
Sherlock Holmes never said "Elementary, my dear Watson" in any of the stories by Conan Doyle. However, that phrase has been used frequently in the movies and was even mistakenly cited in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations for 1937 and 1948. The actual quotation is as follows:
     "I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson," said he. "When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long one you use a hansom. As I perceive that your boots, although used, are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present busy enough to justify the hansom."
     "Excellent!" I cried.
     "Elementary," said he. "It is one of those instances where the reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his neighbour, because the latter has missed the one little point which is the basis of the deduction. The same may be said, my dear fellow, for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted to the reader.

### Heading 3
### You know my methods, Watson.
This quotation appears in nearly identical phrases in at least five Holmes stories. While technically tied with the next passage, it's ranked second because early editions of the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations included multiple appearances of this phrase.

"It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious individual. You know my methods, Watson. There was not one of them which I did not apply to the inquiry. And it ended by my discovering traces, but very different ones from those which I had expected."

     Sherlock Holmes in "The Crooked Man" (Doubleday p. 416)


#### Heading 4
#### When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever...
"You will not apply my precept," he said, shaking his head. "How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth? We know that he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no concealment possible. When, then, did he come?"
     The Sign of the Four, ch. 6 (1890)
     Sherlock Holmes in The Sign of the Four (Doubleday p. 111)

##### Heading 5
##### London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers...
  I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought."
     A Study in Scarlet, ch. 1 (1887)
     Dr. Watson in A Study in Scarlet (Doubleday p. 15)
###### Heading 6
###### To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman.
To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen.... And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
     The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892)
     Dr. Watson in "A Scandal in Bohemia" (Doubleday p. 161)
